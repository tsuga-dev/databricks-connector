"""
Spark Python Data Source (PDS) module for Lakeflow Community Connectors.

This module provides the infrastructure for registering LakeflowSource
data sources with Spark. The ingestion-agent operation surface lives
inside the same ``lakeflow_connect`` format — set the ``operation``
option to dispatch to the agent surface instead of the regular table
read path.
